Think of Artistry like a team of specialists working together:

**1. The Scanner** 👁️
- Looks at your photo
- Identifies all objects (like furniture, decorations)
- Similar to how your brain recognizes objects in a photo

**2. The Mapper** 🗺️

- Understands which parts are walls, floor, furniture
- Like creating a detailed floor plan

**3. The Advisor** 💭

- Thinks about what would look good
- Provides expert recommendations

**4. The Artist** 🎨
- Takes all the information
- Creates a new, redesigned version
- Like a digital interior designer painting a new vision

### Why It's Different

2. Wait days for consultations
3. Pay thousands for renderings
4. Hope you like the result

**Artistry Way**:
1. Upload a photo (2 seconds)
2. Click "Start" (1 second)
3. Wait 30-60 seconds

## Troubleshooting

### "Nothing Happens When I Upload"

**Try this**:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try a different photo
3. Make sure photo is under 10MB
4. Refresh the page and try again

### "I Get an Error Message"

**Common fixes**:

- Processing error → Try again

### "It's Taking Too Long"

**Normal times**:
- Detection: 2-3 seconds
- Segmentation: 3-5 seconds
